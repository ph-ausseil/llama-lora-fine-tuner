About the author : 
I work in Data Integration (Middleware, DataHub, API...) & Service Management. I am not a developer. I wanted to make a proof of concept on the uses of LLM in a company stack so the LLM would know about the business environment and improve a company's decision-making.

Disclaimer for my employer :
This has been developed over one weekend on my personal time.
